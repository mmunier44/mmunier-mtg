For the 2nd General Assembly project I focused on simple object oriented development.

Even on the initial ERD build and wireframe for the UI front I wanted the initial project to be as simple as possible to mainly focus on the process of completing a full stack application.

After every single feature or design tweak every CRUD function was tested and retested in case of error catching.
By testing during design any bugs that were caught were fixable and did not cascade down to the rest of the code.

If a data object that was being passed through the different functions was incorrect I did not have to hunt through multiple functions in order to fix every one.

I wanted as simple of a design to focus on getting all authentication functionality completed.

The final product would be a way to create decks from older sets with a twinge of nostalgia.

#### Developer Evolution Goals
//NOTE
UX/UI
Clean up the design of the application and focus more on the wireframe/appearance of a completed application.
Scaffold out decks and hands and connect to a 3rd party API to pull in furthur feature details
